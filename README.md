2. **Configuration**: Edit `config.lua` with your Discord bot token and server settings
3. **Discord Setup**: Configure your Discord bot and webhook URLs
4. **Start Resource**: Add `start bl-queue` to your server.cfg

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Discord Settings

```lua
Config.Discord = {
    enabled = true,
    guildId = 'YOUR_DISCORD_SERVER_ID',
    botToken = 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN',
    requireServerMembership = true,
    roles = {
        ["ROLE_ID"] = { name = "VIP", points = 100 },
        -- Add more roles with their priority points
    }
}
```

### Queue Settings

```lua
Config.QueueUpdateRate = 2000  -- How often to update queue (ms)
Config.TimeoutDuration = 300000  -- Player timeout duration (ms)
Config.JoinDelay = 1000  -- Delay before processing connection (ms)
```

### Priority System

```lua
Config.QueueTimePoints = {
    enabled = true,
    pointsPerInterval = 1,  -- Points given per interval
    intervalSeconds = 2     -- How often to award points
}
```

## üéÆ Admin Commands

- `queue` - Show current queue status and all players
- `clearqueue` - Remove all players from queue
- `queuestats` - Display detailed queue statistics
- `reloadtemplate` - Reload the present card template
- `setpriority <player_id> <priority>` - Manually set player priority
- `kickqueue <player_id> [reason]` - Remove specific player from queue

## üì± API Exports

### Basic Queue Information

```lua
exports['bl-queue']:getQueueCount()  -- Returns number of players in queue
exports['bl-queue']:isInQueue(source)  -- Check if player is queued
exports['bl-queue']:getQueueList()  -- Get all players in queue
```

### Advanced Functions

```lua
exports['bl-queue']:getPrioData(source)  -- Get player priority information
exports['bl-queue']:getQueueStats()  -- Get detailed queue statistics
exports['bl-queue']:addPriorityPoints(source, points)  -- Add priority points
exports['bl-queue']:removeFromQueue(source, reason)  -- Remove player from queue
```

## üé® Customization

### Present Card Template

Edit `presentCard.json` to customize the queue display:

- Player information layout
- Colors and styling
- Background images
- Text and messaging

### Language Support

Modify `lang.lua` to change all player-facing messages:

- Connection messages
- Error messages
- Queue status text
- Role descriptions

### Webhook Notifications

Configure Discord webhooks for different events:

- Player joins/leaves queue
- System status updates
- Admin actions
- Error notifications

## üîß Advanced Features

### Reconnect Priority System

Players who disconnect get temporary priority when reconnecting:

```lua
Config.ReconnectPrio = {
    enabled = true,
    timeLimit = 300,  -- 5 minutes to reconnect
    extraPoints = 50  -- Bonus priority points
}
```

### Anti-Spam Protection

Prevents rapid connection attempts:

```lua
Config.AntiSpam = {
    enabled = true,
    joinDelay = 10000  -- 10 seconds between attempts
}
```

### Queue Time Bonuses

Reward players for waiting in queue:

```lua
Config.QueueTimePoints = {
    enabled = true,
    pointsPerInterval = 1,  -- Points per interval
    intervalSeconds = 30    -- Award points every 30 seconds
}
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Discord integration not working**: Check bot token and permissions
- **Present cards not showing**: Verify `presentCard.json` is valid
- **Queue not processing**: Check server maxplayers setting
- **Players timing out**: Adjust timeout duration in config

### Debug Commands

Use `testmvc` console command to verify all system components are loaded correctly.
